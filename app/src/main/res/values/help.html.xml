    <string name="guide_text"><![CDATA[<h1>About</h1>
<p>With Debitum you can track all kinds of IOUs, be it money or lent items. This way you will never
forget if your friend already gave you back that book anymore or dispute about much you owe your
colleague for coffee.</p>

<p>There is no online service whatsoever involved, so your data is saved on your
device only (as far as this app is concerned).</p>

<h1>Usage</h1>
<p>To take note of lent money or items, you need to create a transaction using the red floating
action button. There you can enter details like amount, description or date and switch between a
money- or an item-transaction.</p>

<p>Via the Bottom Navigation you can choose different views of your transactions:

    <ul>
    <li>People: summarized by person, ordered by last transaction date
        <ul>
            <li>you can tap on a row to filter the money- and items list by that person</li>
            <li>you can create a new Person from the menu of this screen or using the + button while creating a new transaction</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Money: Shows only monetary transactions, ordered by date (descending)</li>
    <li>Items: Shows only lent items, ordered by date (descending). There is currently no extra way to mark an
     item as returned, so returned item\'s transactions should simply be deleted.</li>
     </ul>

From the Settings Screen you can backup and restore the database (contains all transactions and persons).
Make sure to move backup files out of the way before uninstalling the app or clearing app data, as
currently the backup is saved in the app\'s data folder on external storage, which is deleted upon
uninstall/clearing app data.</p>]]></string>

With Debitum you can track all kinds of IOUs, be it money or lent items. This 
way you will never forget if your friend already gave you back that book 
anymore or dispute about much you owe your colleague for coffee.

You can backup and restore the database where persons and transactions are stored.

There is no online service whatsoever involved, so your data is saved on your
device only (as far as this app is concerned).
